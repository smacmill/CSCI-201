## About
"Much of your computer programming experience is likely using C++ (at least if you took CSCI 103 and CSCI 104). In this course, Java is the language we will primarily use. To help transition your knowledge from C++ to Java, you will be creating a program that looks up restaurants and menu items based on user search criteria. This assignment requires you to parse a file containing a set of restaurants and their respective menu items. To ensure accurate parsing, you will then provide a command line interface to allow a user to query the parsed data."

An example file for parsing is provided in restaurant.txt
